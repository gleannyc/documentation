# Changelog

## August 4th, 2022

It's been a hot Glean summer over here in NYC as weâ€™ve been working hard to ship features, big and small. Here are some highlights of what weâ€™ve been up to.

### Multiple Chart Breakout ðŸŽ‰

We are beyond excited to share our newest analytics tool to answer deeper data questions. Weâ€™ve added a second way to break out your data, multiple chart breakout. (aka small multiples, trellis charts, or faceting)

Combine color and multiple chart breakouts to visually compare metrics by two attributes. Weâ€™re excited to hear what you learn!

### Your homepage just got more useful

Last month, we released some updates to your Glean homepage that make it easier to find what you are looking for and see whatâ€™s most active in your organization.
* You can sort a list of all items in your project that are private to you, recently edited, or our favorite: most viewed.
* Weâ€™ve added visual previews of your data from recent activity.

---

### Scheduled dashboard emails

Now you can schedule your dashboards to be sent to any email. ðŸ¥³

Emails have links back to Glean so your team can always dig deeper if they have additional questions.

Extra credit: Send Glean reports to a Slack channel using their [native email integration](https://nyc.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6300d55bcba31646550d3c1e4&id=06a81c7c2b&e=454d9cfee6)

---

### Quality of life improvements

Weâ€™ve also implemented a bunch of small but powerful improvements that will hopefully make your life a tad easier.

* Sort tables in dashboards without editing the dashboard or saved view.
* Model builder now supports previewing charts with breakout, multiple chart types, and multiple metrics.
* Filters in the explorer and dashboard have been updated to show more information and are easier to use.

### SOC 2 Type II audit completed

Glean had previously gone through a SOC 2 type I audit and recently went through the type II audit. We received our SOC 2 Type II report with zero exceptions!

## June 20th, 2022

Hello Beta Customers,

Itâ€™s been a minute since weâ€™ve sent out an update! Weâ€™ve been busy building after our launch even while weâ€™ve been onboarding lots of teams / new users. See what weâ€™ve been up to:


### New Data Model Workbench

![image](/assets/product_updates/220620_model_workbench.png){alt="Screenshot of the new model workbench highlighting sql editor"}
Weâ€™ve rebuilt our model builder from the ground up. Now, you can preview your data while writing SQL or customizing attributes and metrics.

### Reorder your attributes

![image](/assets/product_updates/220620_reorder_attributes.png){alt="The glean user interface with an attribute tile being moved with drag and drop"}
You can now reorder the attributes in the Explorer! Just click-and-drag to bring the most important attributes to the beginning of the list.

### Undo-Redo

![image](/assets/product_updates/220622_undo_redo.png){alt="Glean interface with undo and redo buttons highlighted"}
Weâ€™ve added undo-redo buttons in the Explorer to make it easier to test changes. The browser back button now takes you back to the previous page.
