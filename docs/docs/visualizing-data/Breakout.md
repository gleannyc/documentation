Breaking out an attribute in Glean splits the visualization by the categories in that attribute. In a timeseries bar chart for example, you can map color to an attribute.

## Adding and removing a breakout

- **From the Attribute Panel:** The easiest way to break out by an attribute is to select the Breakout button from any attribute panel in the [Attributes tray](Attributes-Tray.md).
- **From the top Control Bar:** You can quickly view or remove a breakout from the top control bar just about your chart.
- **From the Controls Panel:** As with other data configurations, you can always view and remove a breakout by clicking the `Controls` tab on the right-hand panel.

## Adding breakout items

Glean visualizes the top six items in your attribute by default, the rest of the items are bucketed together into an `Other` category. This allows you to visualize the distribution of very high-[cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality) columns easily. You can always add more groups if you want in the attribute panel, but generally, you shouldn't visualize too many items at a time - this is why we pick a low number as a default. You can control the number of groups from the attribute panel, see the [Attributes tray](Attributes-Tray.md) page for more details.

## Color Breakout

Colors for your breakouts are selected based on a color palette. The default palette is named `Twilight` and has been designed with a range of colors to vary by hue and luminosity so that it's easy to tell groups apart.

You can also create and use your own [custom color palettes](../project-management/custom-styles.md).

## Break out into multiple charts (trellis charts)

Breaking out into multiple charts allows you to create a trellis chart, a series of separate sub-charts for each category in the attribute. This type of breakout is known as faceting, a trellis plot, or small multiples.

A trellis chart makes it easy to compare different slices of your data side-by-side, which can be easier to interpret than a chart like a stacked bar chart.

Trellis charts can be particularly effective when combined with a color breakout or multiple metrics.

In the attribute panel, click the arrow on the right side of the Breakout button to break out into multiple charts.

## Hiding the `Other` category

Sometimes you might want to hide the other category to make the comparison between items more clear. To hide the other category click the `hide other` button at the bottom of the attribute tray or in the control panel.
