The YAML Editor allows you to update resources through the app using [DataOps](index.md) configs. The editor allows you to easily iterate on Glean resources as code and see changes in realtime. You can save your changes and explore via the application as usual while the YAML editor is enabled. Configs can also be copied directly from the editor into future data ops builds.

The YAML Editor is currently available in the Model Builder and in the Data Explorer.

## Enabling the YAML Editor in the Model Builder

From the model builder, you can enable to YAML editor by clicking on the YAML editor icon on the upper right corner of the center panel in the model builder.

Refer to the [Data Model Config Schema](config-schema/Data-Model.md) for how to format your config files in the YAML editor.
