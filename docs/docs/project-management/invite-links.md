Project invite links make it easy to allow your team to join your project.

Simply turn on `Project Invite Links` on the [Settings]({{ glean_url }}/app/p/settings){:target="\_blank"} page and share the generated URL with the invite token.

Turning off `Project Invite Links` will invalidate the invite token and link. Each time the setting is turned on, a new token is generated.

Users joining using the invite link will be given the [default role(s)](./users-and-permissions.md) configured for your project.
