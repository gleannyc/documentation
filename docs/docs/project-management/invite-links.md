Project invite links make it allow people to join your project.

Simply turn on `Project Invite Links` on the [Settings](https://glean.io/app/p/settings){:target="\_blank"} page and share the generated URL with the invite token.

Turning off `Project Invite Links` will invalidate the invite token and link. Each time the setting is turned on, a new token is generated.
