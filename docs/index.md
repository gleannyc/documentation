### 1.  Define your Data Model

Your data models define metrics and filters upfront so you can analyze data without writing writing code everytime. See the [Data Modeling Overview](docs/data-modeling/Data-Models-Overview/)

### 2.  Analyze and Explore

Glean automatically sets up an intuitive data explorer for each data model.

You can save views of the data that are important to your organization.

### 3.  Share

When you find something interesting, create share links, saved views and dashboards to share insights with your team.
