## Glean workflow

### 1.  Define your Data Models

Your data models define metrics and filters upfront so you can analyze data without writing writing code everytime.

### 2.  Analyze and Explore

Glean automatically sets up an intuitive data exploration dashboard for each data model.

You can save views of the data that are important to your organization.

### 3.  Share

When you find something interesting, create a share link to let others dig in.

The whole team is now empowered to dig into the data and share hypotheses.
