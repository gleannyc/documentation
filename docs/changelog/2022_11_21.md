# November 21st, 2022

Hi friends of Glean!

The team is really excited coming into the end of the year and coming off of Maker Week - some time we dedicated to working on longer-term product experiments.  We made enough progress during the week to get a lot of these projects on the roadmap.  We’re also now updating a [public version of our product](../product-roadmap/product-roadmap.md).  Hit us up on Slack or email me directly if you have any feedback.

Now for some highlights from the last month:
- **Custom Color Palettes**
- **Improved filtering and breaking out interactions**
- **Project invite links**
- **Resource history**
- **Other improvements and fixes**: negative values in stacked charts, partner projects, explorer embeds, improved DataOps builds

## Custom Color Palettes

### Customize your chart colors!

You can now add customized color pallettes to your project and use them in any chart.  Head over to the [settings page](https://glean.io/app/p/settings#custom_styles) to add new pallettes or use [DataOps  to configure palettes with code](https://docs.glean.io/docs/data-ops/config-schema/Color-Palette/).  You can set the color pallette for a specific view to help tell a more effective data story - like using green for increases and red for decreases in revenue.

You can also override Glean’s **default color pallette** to make your project feel tailored to your organization.  Your default pallette will automatically be applied to every chart in your project without custom colors configured which will keep your project looking consistent :sparkle:

## Automatically add teammates with Invite Links

You can generate a secret invite link that allows your teammates to join your project.  You can now avoid having to manually add the email address of each teammate individually.

---

## Resource History
You can now see the change history for dashboards and saved views in Glean.  Who updated this view and when?  Did this view get updated with a DataOps build?  Click on the arrow next to a resource to see the resource’s history.

## Improved attribute filtering and breaking out

We did a big pass on improving the UX of breaking out and filtering from the attributes tray.  Now it’s easier to compare items in an attribute: say customer A versus customer B while excluding other customers.  Breaking out an attribute now pulls up a more clear drawer where you can configure a breakout.  You can now rearrange items and filter out items in your breakout much more easily.

---

## Other improvements and fixes:
- **Allow negative values in stacked bar charts** - this can be helpful for showing positive and negative contributions to a total, like revenue.
- **Invite customers into shared Partner Projects** - You can now create a separate project to allow you to safely share data and empower data exploration for your partners without having to invite them into your main project.
- **Explorer embed beta** - We now have a version of our data explorer that can be embedded into other applications.  Ask us about joining the beta!
- **Improved DataOps builds with other tools like dbt** - We now do a fast check on yml and json files to make sure they are a Glean type before trying to parse them.  This allows you to more easily trigger DataOps builds when there are other types of configuration files in the same folder.
